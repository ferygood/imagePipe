## Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery
Create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments (i.e. drug response), researchers can understand the underlying biological processes at work.
